## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 System Overview
The SATIM Call Center Automation system is a modular, event-driven backend application built using Python and FastAPI. It consists of multiple components (agents) that handle specific tasks, coordinated by a central system orchestrator. The architecture follows a microservices-inspired design, with each component communicating via an event bus.

### 2.2 Components
- **CallRouter**: Assigns incoming calls to available agents or queues them based on priority and agent load.
- **FAQBot**: Processes customer questions and matches them to pre-stored FAQs using NLP techniques.
- **DataEntryAutomator**: Extracts structured data (e.g., phone numbers, account numbers) from call transcripts using regex and NLP.
- **SpeechToTextProcessor**: Converts audio recordings or real-time audio streams into text using speech recognition.
- **SystemCoordinator**: Initializes and monitors components, performs health checks, and manages system metrics.
- **EventBus**: Facilitates asynchronous communication between components using a publish-subscribe model.
- **Database**: Stores call records, agent status, FAQs, and queue information using SQLite (for development).
- **API**: Provides endpoints for health checks, incoming calls, FAQ questions, and system interaction using FastAPI.

### 2.4 Event-Driven Communication
The EventBus enables asynchronous communication between components. Events (e.g., `call_incoming`, `question_asked`, `call_transcript_ready`) are published by one component and subscribed to by others, ensuring loose coupling and scalability.

## 3. Technologies

### 3.1 Core Technologies
- **Python 3.x**: Primary programming language for its versatility and extensive libraries.
- **FastAPI**: Web framework for building high-performance APIs with async support.
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database interactions with SQLite.
- **SpeechRecognition**: Library for converting audio to text (using Google Speech Recognition in the provided code).
- **Scikit-learn & Transformers**: Used in FAQBot for TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity for question matching.
- **Logging**: Built-in Python logging for system monitoring and debugging.

### 3.2 Dependencies
Key dependencies (from `requirements.txt`, inferred):
- `fastapi`
- `uvicorn`
- `sqlalchemy`
- `speechrecognition`
- `scikit-learn`
- `transformers`
- `numpy`

### 3.3 Database
- **SQLite**: Used for development due to its simplicity and zero-configuration setup.

  - `agents`: Stores agent details (ID, name, status, created_at).
  - `calls`: Stores call records (ID, caller_phone, agent_id, status, timestamps, transcript, summary, resolved).
  - `call_queue`: Manages queued calls (ID, caller_phone, priority, created_at, assigned_agent_id).
  - `faqs`: Stores FAQs (ID, question, answer, category, usage_count, created_at).

## 4. Methods and Strategies

### 4.1 Development Methodology
- **Agile Development**: Iterative development with focus on modular components and continuous testing.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Unit tests (e.g., `test_faq_bot.py`) and integration tests (`api_test.py`) ensure reliability.
- **Modular Design**: Each component (CallRouter, FAQBot, etc.) is self-contained, promoting reusability and maintainability.

### 4.2 Call Routing Strategy
- **Load Balancing**: Uses a round-robin algorithm to distribute calls based on agent load (number of active calls).
- **Priority Queuing**: Calls with higher priority are processed first when agents become available.
- **Event-Driven Routing**: Incoming calls trigger events (`call_incoming`) handled by the CallRouter, which either assigns an agent or queues the call.

### 4.3 FAQ Handling Strategy
- **NLP-Based Matching**: Uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to match customer questions to FAQs.
- **Confidence Threshold**: Only returns answers with a similarity score above 0.7 to ensure accuracy.
- **Database-Driven**: FAQs are stored in the database, allowing dynamic updates and usage tracking.

### 4.4 Data Entry Automation
- **Regex Patterns**: Extracts structured data (e.g., phone numbers, emails, account numbers) using predefined regex patterns.
- **NLP Enhancements**: Identifies customer names, addresses, and issue types using keyword matching and regex.
- **Validation**: Cleans and validates extracted data before storing it in the database.

### 4.5 Speech-to-Text Processing
- **Real-Time and Batch Processing**: Supports both real-time audio streams and recorded audio files.
- **Google Speech Recognition**: Used for transcription (configurable for French, suitable for Algeria).
- **Error Handling**: Publishes error events for failed transcriptions, ensuring system resilience.

### 4.6 System Coordination
- **Health Monitoring**: Periodic health checks on components to detect and restart unhealthy ones.
- **Metrics Tracking**: Monitors active calls, queue length, and agent availability, publishing alerts for anomalies.
- **Async Operations**: Uses asyncio for non-blocking operations, improving performance under high load.

### 4.7 Integration Strategy
- **CRM and Telephony Connectors**: Placeholder classes (`CRMConnector`, `TelephonyConnector`) allow future integration with external systems.
- **Configurability**: System configuration (e.g., API keys, URLs) is passed via a config dictionary, enabling easy customization.

## 5. Coverage of the Problematic

- **Basic NLP**: FAQBot uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity, which may not handle complex queries as effectively as advanced LLMs.
- **Speech Recognition Dependency**: Relies on Google Speech Recognition, which requires internet access and may incur costs.
- **Single Database**: SQLite is not suitable for production-scale concurrency; a more robust database (e.g., PostgreSQL) is needed.
- **Incomplete Integrations**: CRM and telephony connectors are placeholders, requiring additional development for production use.

## 6. Future Enhancements
- **Frontend Development**: Build a web dashboard using React or Flask for real-time monitoring and management.
- **Advanced NLP**: Integrate a transformer-based model (e.g., BERT) for better FAQ matching and intent recognition.
- **Scalable Database**: Migrate to PostgreSQL or MySQL for production scalability.
- **Full Integrations**: Implement CRM and telephony API integrations for end-to-end automation.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Enhance SpeechToTextProcessor and FAQBot to support additional languages (e.g., Arabic).
- **AI-Driven Insights**: Use machine learning to analyze call transcripts for customer sentiment and issue trends.

## 7. Conclusion
The SATIM Call Center Automation project successfully addresses key inefficiencies in call center operations through a modular, event-driven backend system. By automating call routing, FAQ handling, data entry, and speech processing, it reduces manual effort, improves customer experience, and provides real-time insights. While limitations exist (e.g., no frontend, basic NLP), the system is a robust foundation for scalable call center automation, with clear paths for future enhancements.
